# Small_Project_Group_14
Project Requirements: Remote database Use any stack, but WISA, Lamp, and MEAN are preferred. Use JSon to communicate between client and server. You can use a web page, a windows program, or an andriod/iOS app as the client. (A web page must be AJAX enabled.)  The program is a personal contact manager. Each user needs a login. For each user, they can add their own contacts (not shared contacts). They can search for and delete contacts.
